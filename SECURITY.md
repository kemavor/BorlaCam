# Security Policy

## 🔒 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes            |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No             |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please help us keep BorlaCam secure by responsibly disclosing any security issues you discover.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: `security@yourdomain.com` (replace with actual email)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if known)

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

2. **Initial Assessment**: We'll perform an initial assessment within 5 business days and provide an estimated timeline for resolution.

3. **Resolution**: We'll work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, typically within:
   - **Critical**: 1-2 days
   - **High**: 3-7 days  
   - **Medium**: 1-4 weeks
   - **Low**: 1-3 months

4. **Disclosure**: Once fixed, we'll coordinate disclosure with you, typically within 30 days of the fix.

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Current Security Features

- **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated and sanitized
- **CORS Protection**: Configurable CORS origins for API security
- **Container Security**: Docker containers run with non-root users
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning via GitHub Actions
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded credentials or secrets

### Recommended Deployment Security

#### Production Environment

```bash
# Use HTTPS in production
FLASK_ENV=production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com

# Enable security headers
SECURE_HEADERS=true
```

#### Docker Security

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  borlacam-api:
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
    user: "1000:1000"
```

#### Network Security

- Use reverse proxy (Nginx) for production
- Implement rate limiting
- Use firewalls to restrict access
- Enable HTTPS with valid certificates

#### API Security

```python
# Implement rate limiting
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(
    app,
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    default_limits=["100 per hour"]
)

@app.route('/api/predict', methods=['POST'])
@limiter.limit("10 per minute")
def predict():
    # API endpoint with rate limiting
    pass
```

## 🔍 Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Dependency Management**
   ```bash
   # Regularly update dependencies
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements_production.txt
   
   # Check for vulnerabilities
   pip-audit -r requirements_production.txt
   ```

2. **Code Security**
   - Never commit secrets or API keys
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Container Security**
   - Use official base images
   - Keep images updated
   - Run containers as non-root
   - Use minimal base images

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Security**
   ```bash
   # Use environment variables for secrets
   export API_KEY="your-secret-key"
   export DB_PASSWORD="your-db-password"
   ```

2. **Network Security**
   ```bash
   # Use firewalls
   ufw allow 80/tcp
   ufw allow 443/tcp
   ufw enable
   ```

3. **Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Monitor logs for suspicious activity
   tail -f logs/borlacam_api.log | grep "ERROR\|WARN"
   ```
